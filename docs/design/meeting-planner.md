Goal: build a simple and intuitive tool that allows a team to view overlapping times in their schedules and plan weekly meetings.

#### User Stories

As a user I want

1. to add my weekly schedule after signup.
    - This ensures that every user gets an opportunity to fill out their schedule.
    - It is important to motivate the users to fill out their schedules (incetives: match with a team that you'll work well with, increase productivity of exisiting team, some form of gamification)

2. to edit my schedule.
    - Send notification to Project Owner or Scrum mater when a member has updated their schedule.

3. to view my team's collective schedule.
    - Explain the purpose of this overlap schedule is to bootstrap the tedious plannig stages of group scheduling.

4. to select prefered blocks in the collective schedule so that popular weekly meeting times are visible to the whole team.

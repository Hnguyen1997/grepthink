<h4 id="whatisgroupthink">What is GroupThink?</h4>

<ul>
<li>GroupThink facilitates team formation for the purpose of developing and collaborating on group projects in an educational environment.</li>

<li>The platform allows professors to create private and organized spaces for students to post project ideas and join existing projects.</li>

<li>Using user profiles, GroupThink will match students with other member of their class based on technical skills, schedule, prior coursework, project ideas, and interests.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="motivation">Motivation</h4>

<ul>
<li>Traditional team forming for group projects is a haphazard process that puts stress on individuals and leads to disjoint groups.</li>

<li>Current tools used for group projects (i.e. Google Sheets, Piazza Forms) are unorganized and lack functionality.</li>

<li>By matching students based on their profiles and project goals, GroupThink will help create groups that work and learn better together.</li>

<li>It is also a reaction to the faculty to student ratio at UCSC. Many classes now have to rely on group projects to make grading possible. This can be a great learning experience but can be a hurdle for many students that struggle to find a group they fit into.</li>
</ul>
